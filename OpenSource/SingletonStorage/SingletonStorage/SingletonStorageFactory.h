// Singleton objects stored at one place (Singleton Storage)
// that manages the creation and destruction of the singleton objects
// in the pre-defined order.
// A singleton instance goes through states:
// 1. Non-exists yet
// 2. Created
// 3. Destroyed
// The attempt to create a second instance
// of the already destroyed singleton type
// will throw the correspondent exception,
// re-creation of the singleton instances is not allowed.

// Also the recursive creation of singletons is not allowed, example:
// A::A() { SingletonStorageFactory::create<B>(); }
// B::B() { SingletonStorageFactory::create<A>(); }

// At the same time the chain creation is allowed, example:
// A::A() { SingletonStorageFactory<B>(); } 
// B::B() { SingletonStorageFactory<C>(); } 
// C::C() {}
// SingletonStorageFactory::create<A>(); -> creates objects in order C, B, A.
